# Prompt / Grounding Notes (Planned)

We will use:
- A strict response format (JSON) from the model
- A grounding strategy where catalog specs come from local dataset only
- Model used mainly for language + explanations, not for inventing specs

Known limitation (initial):
- Catalog is a mock dataset; coverage limited to included models
